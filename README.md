# 2-Dimensional-Array
## Aim:
### To study and implement operations using two-dimensional arrays in C++, including input/output, summation, multiplication, and traversal techniques.
## Theory:
 A 2D array in C++ is essentially an array of arrays, allowing data to be stored in a row-column format—ideal for representing matrices, grids, or tabular data.
### Common Operations

   #### Matrix Addition: Add corresponding elements of two matrices.

  ####  Matrix Multiplication: Multiply rows of one matrix with columns of another.

  ####  Transpose: Flip rows and columns.

  #### Carry Use: In arithmetic operations (like addition), carry values may be stored temporarily in a 2D array to simulate multi-digit operations or grid-based logic.

### Memory Layout

#### 2D arrays are stored in row-major order—meaning elements of each row are stored in contiguous memory locations.
